# Food Planet (TINS 2025)

My contribution for TINS 2025 (https://tins.amarillion.org/news/)

Food Planet is a game about food webs. You start with a barren planet. Along
the way you get more tools to populate your planet, but be careful to maintain
the balance.

Different organisms eat each other, so it is good to watch closely how they 
interact. One of your new organisms could be a preditor or prey in the new
balance. This **food** web is the core of the game.

Technically, the game is implemented by going through different **layers**
of simulation. These are done in order and are rendered to the screen in
order, where more primitive organisms are at the bottom and more advanced
at the top.

To place different organisms, you first have to select the tool from the
**cute** buttons on the right (#TODO).

Can you find the **golden ratio** that keeps most types of organisms alive
in a steady equilibrium?
