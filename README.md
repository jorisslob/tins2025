# Food Planet (TINS 2025)

My contribution for TINS 2025 (https://tins.amarillion.org/news/)

Food Planet is a game about food webs. You start with a barren planet. Along
the way you get more tools to populate your planet, but be careful to maintain
the balance.

Different organisms eat each other, so it is good to watch closely how they 
interact. One of your new organisms could be a preditor or prey in the new
balance. This **food** web is the core of the game.

Technically, the game is implemented by going through different **layers**
of simulation. These are done in order and are rendered to the screen in
order, where more primitive organisms are at the bottom and more advanced
at the top.

To place different organisms, you first have to select the tool from the
**cute** buttons on the right (#TODO).

Can you find the **golden ratio** that keeps most types of organisms alive
in a steady equilibrium?

## What can you find in the world?

### Water

Water likes to bundle together in puddles.

### Plant

Plants need water to grow.

### Orago

Chill creature that likes to eat plants

### Kakora

### Mycelon

## Known Issues

- Clicks of water seem too tedious
- All elements can grow out of the planet
- Kakoras don't do anything yet
- Mycelons don't do anything yet
- Make this into a fun game
- Waterdrops sometimes jumps when they join
